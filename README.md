The Text File Analyzer is implemented in assembly language, specifically designed to harness the
capabilities of the underlying hardware. The solution will include modules for character counting, word
counting, line counting, pattern matching, and other text-related operations. The goal is to achieve a
balance between precision and speed, catering to scenarios where quick and efficient text file analysis is
paramount.
